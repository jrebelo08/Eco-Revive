# API Server Code Overview

This directory contains the code that runs on the web server to provide API endpoints for interacting with the Admin SDK.

## Important Notes

- The code is complete, but to make it functional, you need to provide the Firebase project's private key.
- The Admin SDK libraries are required but not included in this repository.
